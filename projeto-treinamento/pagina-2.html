                EXT. A DESERT-LIKE-LANDSCAPE. DAY<br/>
                <br/>
                Like Kubrick’s 2001, but with little girls, not apes. And<br/>
                with baby dolls, not sticks and stuff.<br/>
                <br/>
                HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)<br/>
                Since the beginning of time, since<br/>
                the first little girl ever existed,<br/>
                there have been dolls.<br/>
                <br/>
                These little girls rock their baby dolls, they burp them,<br/>
                they cuddle them: They pretend to be Moms.<br/>
                <br/>
                HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)<br/>
                But the dolls were always and<br/>
                forever baby dolls. The girls who<br/>
                played with them could only ever<br/>
                play at being MOTHERS. Which can be<br/>
                fun, at least for a while anyway...<br/>
                Ask your mother.<br/>
                (pause)<br/>
                This continued, until...<br/>
                <br/>
                One of the girls looks UP.<br/>
                <br/>
                Something has appeared in their midst. Something NEW.<br/>
                It’s a GIANT BARBIE DOLL - BARBIE MARGOT, the 1950s Barbie,<br/>
                with her black and white swimsuit and lipstick.<br/>
                <br/>
                The girls react with awe.<br/>
                <br/>
                They’re stirred up and excited by this Barbie Margot not<br/>
                unlike the apes in that Kubrick masterpiece. They try to<br/>
                touch her, and one little girl starts smashing her baby doll<br/>
                against the ground until it breaks into pieces. She lets out<br/>
                a child’s howl!<br/>
                <br/>
                One by one the little girls follow suit: whooping, screaming,<br/>
                throwing their baby dolls away in fits of joyful anger.<br/>
                <br/>
                A final little girl throws her baby doll up in the air, and<br/>
                it is spinning, spinning - with a match cut to:<br/>
                <br/>
                BARBIE<br/>
                INT. WHITE SPACE<br/>
                <br/>
                Barbie stands in a empty space of the soon-to-be formed<br/>
                Barbie Land - it’s a void, a limbo - but clearly in a film<br/>
                studio. The World of Barbie is a Technicolor Soundstage.<br/>
                <br/>
                HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)<br/>
                Yes Barbie changed everything! Then<br/>
                she changed it all again!<br/>
                <br/>
                We go through all the changes to Barbie Margot, as she moves<br/>
                through the decades.<br/>
                <br/>
                HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)<br/>
                All of these women are Barbie, and<br/>
                Barbie is all of these women. She<br/>
                might have started out as just a<br/>
                lady in a bathing suit, but she<br/>
                became so much more.<br/>
                <br/>
                We see a row of Barbies. As we move back we see that “Barbie”<br/>
                is a EVERY different kind of woman -- every profession, every<br/>
                ethnicity, every body shape, every different ability and<br/>
                every gift. As we pan by each one, we hear:<br/>
                <br/>
                HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)<br/>
                She has her own money, her own<br/>
                house, her own car, her own career.<br/>
                Because Barbie can be anything,<br/>
                women can be anything.<br/>
                <br/>
                We see a Map with Barbie Land on it and a long red arrow is<br/>
                drawn across a split screen to the Real World.<br/>
                <br/>
                HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)<br/>
                (triumphantly)<br/>
                And this has been reflected back<br/>
                onto the little girls of today in<br/>
                the Real World.<br/>
                <br/>
                Girls playing with the different dolls. The girls all mirror<br/>
                what their Barbie is. So the doctor is the doctor, the<br/>
                ballerina is the ballerina, etc.<br/>
                <br/>
                HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)<br/>
                Girls can grow into women who can<br/>
                achieve everything and anything<br/>
                they set their mind to.<br/>
                <br/>
                Finally, we see a vast sea of Barbies. All in different<br/>
                outfits, different hairstyles, adding new friends, speaking<br/>
                different languages. And now Barbie’s world gets continually<br/>
                multi-faceted and wide-ranging and diverse and interesting.<br/>
                <br/>
                HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)<br/>
                (triumphantly)<br/>
                Thanks to Barbie all problems of<br/>
                feminism and equal rights have been<br/>
                solved!<br/>
                (MORE)<br/>
                <br/>
                HELEN MIRREN (V.O.) (CONT'D)<br/>
                (with a knowing smirk)<br/>
                ... at least that’s what the<br/>
                Barbies think.<br/>
                <br/>
                We float above the Barbies into the clouds, then we descend<br/>
                to earth, to see, just below the clouds and above land, the<br/>
                heart-shaped BARBIE LAND.<br/>
                <br/>
                HELEN MIRREN (V.O.)<br/>
                After all they’re living in Barbie<br/>
                Land. Who am I to burst their<br/>
                bubble? And here is one of those<br/>
                Barbies now, living her best day<br/>
                every day.<br/>
